# BAT-MON
A really tiny battery monitoring script to help out my dumb Linux Mint battery monitor which only _displays_ an alert when the battery's low. Even when it's locked, if it runs outta charge, it'll just silently shut itself off. Which has become really inconvenient because I often study keeping important stuff opened that I'll need to look at from time to time. And then there's another issue of _overcharging_, where I'll plug it in and completely forget about the fact that it's been charging for, say, 4 hours.

So I wrote this small script that uses the Linux package _speech-dispatcher_ to yell at you when the battery goes below a certain limit, or if it's being charged, when the charge goes _above_ a certain limit.
